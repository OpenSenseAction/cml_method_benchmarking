# CML method benchmarking
Benchmarking processing methods for commercial microwave link-based rainfall estimation. CML and reference data are taken from the opnMRG dataset from [(Andersson et al. 2022)](https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-5411-2022).
So far there are notebooks for
## Rain event detection
which consider the following methods:
* [Schleiss et al. 2010](10.1109/LGRS.2010.2043052)
* [Graf et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2931-2020)
* [Polz et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-13-3835-2020)
* [Overeem et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-9-2425-2016) 

## Wet antenna attenuation 
which consider the following methods:
* [Schleiss et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2012.2236074)
* [Leijnse et al. 2008](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170808000535)
* [Pastorek et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2021.3110004) (the model denoted "KR-alt" in this study is used here)

Additional notebooks are available that can be used to explore the reference data from openMRG and to derive radar data along the CMLs' path.
